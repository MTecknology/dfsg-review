About DCheck
============

Many disagreements have escalated into larger conflicts due to inconsistent
interpretation and application of ``DFSG`` and ``Policies``. This lack of clear
understanding leads to significant load on review teams which results in one-off
reviews (via NEW) and sometimes a very occasional re-skim (via binNEW) and
ultimately results in significantly reduced enforcement of core principals.

DCheck (.deb checker) is designed to resolve these issues by providing a
checklist-based approach to reviews, along with context-relevant documentation,
historical data, and collaboration.

Three interfaces are (will eventually be) provided:

- Command Line Interface (:ref:`CLI <dcheck-cli>`)
- Graphical User Interface (:ref:`GUI <dcheck-gui>`)
- Web Application (:ref:`WEB <dcheck-web>`)
