About DFSG Review
=================

The ``DFSG Review`` project aims to improve the quality of the Debian package
repository by providing assurance that every package adheres to Debian's strict
interpretation of ``Debian's Free Software Guidelines`` (`DFSG`_), which is
further defined within ``Debian's Policy Manual`` (`Policy`_). Using  Ubuntu's
`Code of Conduct`_ as a guide, and historical frustrations as fuel, we aim to
get to the heart of quality control problems and build permanent solutions.

.. _DFSG: https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines
.. _Policy: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy
.. _Code of Conduct: https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct

DFSG Checker (:ref:`DCheck <dcheck-about>`) helps Debian Developers review
packages for compliance with ``DFSG`` and ``Policy``.
